        Hi, my name is Brian Pham, and I’m an Applied Data Analytics major at Syracuse University with interests in exploring data related to sports, space,
        and video games. I was awarded the iSchool’s Leadership Scholarship and have skills in programming, troubleshooting, and 
        video editing. Outside of academics, I enjoy editing personal videos, playing video games, and watching basketball. I commute 
        from Clay, where I live with my family, and a fun fact about me is that I like eating Doritos with milk. I’m Vietnamese with 
        Chinese heritage.
